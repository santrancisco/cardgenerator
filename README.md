### Intro

This is the source code for [https://cardgenerator.surge.sh/](https://cardgenerator.surge.sh/). This is a simple tool that would let you create card games for family & friends and print them out on A4 sheet. 

The site let you add/modify cards and when you are happy with the result, simply print the website, the HTML dom & stylesheet is configured so only the cards are printed out.

### Example game - Table top exercise

My team and I used the cards and ran a workshop at company event in the past and it was a hit. We created scenarios and let the team decide the category of attacks and security controls that helps defence against these attacks and score them. We let team argue why their attack & defence makes sense and members of security team will be the judge.
